📈 REAL-TIME FINANCIAL FORECASTING WITH CNN-LSTM MODELS

This project focuses on developing a real-time financial forecasting system using a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model. By combining the feature extraction power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the sequence prediction capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, this model aims to accurately predict future stock prices or financial trends based on historical data.

🔍 Key Features:
✅ Preprocessing of time series financial datasets (e.g., stock prices, currency exchange)

✅ CNN layers for capturing local patterns and noise reduction

✅ LSTM layers for learning long-term dependencies in time series

✅ Real-time prediction and visualization of forecasted trends

✅ Evaluation metrics including RMSE, MAE, and R² Score



📊 Use Cases:
Stock market price forecasting

Cryptocurrency trend prediction

Forex and commodity price analysis
